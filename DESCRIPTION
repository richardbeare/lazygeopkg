Description: dplyr verbs for geospatial data stored in geopkg format. Geopkg is
    sqlite and can thus be accessed using standard DB tools. This package provides
    wrapping to return data in simple feature (sf) tables. The concept is identical
    to `lazysf`, but using DBI rather than GDAL to support SQL. This offers
    some advantages in the area of filtering joins and more standard SQL behaviour,
    but only works on geopackage rather than all geospatial file formats.
